We are working together doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted here is code written by us,
except for code copied from the instructor's directories.
We both have read and understood the UC Santa
Cruz Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair 
is responsible for the work performed by the other partner,
and all work has been reviewed by both partners working together. 
Both of us know the format of the PARTNER file.
