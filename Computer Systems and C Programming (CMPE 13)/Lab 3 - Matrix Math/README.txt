In this lab, we worked with functions using definitions and prototypes to perform operations on matrices. We implemented checking if two matrices were equal, multiplication and addition between two matrices or a matrix by a scalar quantity, and finding the trace, determinant, transpose and inverse of a matrix. We also created multiple tests to check the performance of the functions.

My approach to the lab was to first create a function, make sure that it did what I wanted it to, and then create tests that would check the performance of the function. I first read the manual, making sure that I understood everything. I then went one by one through every function, reading its purpose in the manual and checking what it needed to do, and then proceeded to immediately implement it into my code followed by tests for it. It worked well to do every function and test step by step, perfecting it, and then moving onto the next function. I did not work with anyone else in the class.

I ended up putting about 8 hours on this lab. I liked working with functions, but I did not like having to create multiple tests for those functions. It felt tedious, and took up a lot of time because issues that didn't have to do with my functions kept coming up, and all of it was just hardcoding. Otherwise, this lab was fun to do. The hardest part about the lab was that some things from the manual were not clear. I was not sure how the tests were supposed to look like, and how much of it should be hardcoding. I think more examples of tests in the manual would have been better.
