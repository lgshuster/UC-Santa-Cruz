In this lab, we worked with the PICkit 3 LEDS and OLED to display certain results. We had the LEDS light up one at a time and bounce back and forth, display a message on the OLED with the value of the potentiometer, and lit up the LEDS depending on buttons pressed and the value of the potentiometer. 

My first step in this lab was to create the Leds.h, and test it to make sure it worked since the rest of the lab relied on it. I then began working on having the LEDS bounce back and forth, which I did one step at a time, following the lab manual. I started with causing one LED to light up, and then one after another, and finally one after another and changing direction when it came to the last LED. 

I spent about 15 hours on this lab. This lab was fun to work on. We finally got to work with hardware and seeing things light up/display/move rather then only displaying things on screen. A suggestion I have is that I would put all the guides for each part together and close to each other. I kept having to scroll to the top of the lab manual to see the function of each file and then scroll down again to actually see how to implement it.
