Leonid Shuster, with help from Maxim Kuznetsov to create switch statement with states

In this lab, we worked with a switch statement to track the state of our toaster oven. We used interrupts and flags to set and keep track of specific timings, and then used those timings in our switch statement that did a different action depending on what event had just occurred. 

To do this lab, I created my states and transitions one at a time. First, I displayed the default display on the screen. I then worked my way through all the states that could possibly occur, ensuring that they checked for the right events and then transitioned to another if a certain event occurred. It was difficult to keep track of all the states and what they should do, and make sure that they transition correctly when a state changed.

I spent 15-20 hours on this lab. I liked that we worked with event driven programming and saw it come into action. It was enjoyable to see something happen once I clicked or moved something knowing that it came from the code that I wrote. For the lab, I suggest that there be more hints in between each option. It would've helped a lot if there were more help to start the lab with.
